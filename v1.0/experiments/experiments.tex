\section{Analysis}

Here, we analyze the three steps paper from 
\cite{ditmarsch:2011}. The cards leaked to the
agent $C$ are tabulated in table \ref{cLeaked-0}
while the deals that $C$ thinks possible after
each of those runs are tabulated in Table \ref{pDeals-0}.

With these tables, we are able to ascertain that 
our tool agrees with the analysis of \cite{ditmarsch:2011}
as it is a safe protocol and hence any run taken in
isolation is also guaranteed to be safe and hence $C$
does not learn any cards.

\begin{table}[h]
\input{card1}\hfill \quad \input{poss1}\hfill
%\caption{Cards Leaked and Possible Deals}
\end{table}

In the second table, we see that the number of possible
deals is also $5$ after every run and we can in fact prove
it independently that it would be exactly $5$ for each run. 
The above follows from the properties of the first announcement
made by $A$ that always consists of $15$ disjuncts of a
particular kind (type of $1$-designs and $2$-designs). 

The reasoning is that since the first announcement
is such that any card appears in exactly $6$ disjuncts and since
$C$ holds two cards, he can first eliminate $6$ hands of the announcement
for card $x$ that he holds. For the other card $y$, it occurs
in exactly $2$ hands alongwith $x$ and hence he can eliminate
$4$ other disjuncts leaving him with $5$ possibilities. The
later announcements do not reveal any additional information to
$C$ and hence he will be unsure of $5$ possible deals.

\section{Other Measures}

Besides the number of deals that the Eavesdropper thinks possible, we can 
consider other relevant measures of uncertainty after a particular run. 
These measures attempt to capture the remaining uncertainty as well
as vulnerabilities at a more abstract level (using atomic propositions).

For instance, we consider a proposition (or card) to be ``weak'' if
leaking the value of that proposition to the eavesdropper results
in him learning the complete deal. There are no propositions of that kind
for the protocol in \cite{ditmarsch:2011} (for the deal starting 
at $d_0 = <0,1,2,3 \;|\; 4,5,6,7 \;|\; 8,9>$ and run $r_0$).

\begin{verbatim}
> KL
[Kca__0, Kca__1, Kca__2, Kca__3, Kcb__4, Kcb__5, Kcb__6, Kcb__7]
> s1 = s0.execRun(r0)
> map(len, computeRemainingDeals(s1, KL))
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
\end{verbatim}

Thus even if we update the agent $C$'s knowledge with any
of the propositions, she still considers $3$ other possibilities
compatible with her knowledge.

We compute the same for other deals possible after $r_0$ and
we get similar property that $C$ is still unsure of the exact
deal for run $r_0$. However, note that the number of alternate
deals varies for different deals.

\begin{verbatim}
> alternateDeals = s1.getAgtDeals(c)
> for d in alternateDeals:
     s0.deal = d
     s1 = s0.execRun(r0)
     print map(len, computeRemainingDeals(s1, KL))

[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
\end{verbatim}

However, note that not all runs generate the same number of
deals when revealing a particular proposition. In fact,
if we take another run of the protocol $r_1$ and compute
the same measure above, we get that after revealing some
propositions, the number of remaining deals might be $2$
for the Eavesdropper as shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
> r1[0]
('a', [[2, 3, 7, 9],  [0, 1, 7, 9],  [2, 4, 6, 7],  
       [3, 5, 7, 8],  [0, 4, 5, 7],  [1, 6, 7, 8],  
       [2, 5, 8, 9],  [3, 4, 6, 9],  [0, 6, 8, 9],  
       [1, 4, 5, 9],  [0, 1, 2, 3],  [0, 2, 5, 6],
       [1, 2, 4, 8],  [0, 3, 4, 8],  [1, 3, 5, 6]])

> allDeals1, remDeals1, nRem1 = nDealsRemaining(r1, KL)
> nRem1
[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3],
 [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3],
 [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3],
 [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3],
 [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3]]
\end{verbatim}

%> alternateDeals
%[{'a': [2, 3, 4, 5], 'b': [0, 1, 6, 7], 'c': [8, 9]},
% {'a': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6, 7], 'c': [8, 9]},
% {'a': [1, 3, 6, 7], 'b': [0, 2, 4, 5], 'c': [8, 9]},
% {'a': [0, 2, 6, 7], 'b': [1, 3, 4, 5], 'c': [8, 9]},
% {'a': [0, 1, 4, 5], 'b': [2, 3, 6, 7], 'c': [8, 9]}]

\subsection{Weak Pairs}

We can repeat the above experiment for weak pairs 
\begin{verbatim}
> pairKL
[[Kca__0, Kca__1], [Kca__0, Kca__2], [Kca__0, Kca__3], [Kca__1, Kca__3], 
 [Kca__2, Kca__3]]
\end{verbatim}

We get the following result (for $d_0$ and run $r_0$).
\begin{verbatim}
In [1]: %time allDeals0, pairRemDeals0, nPairRem0 = nDealsRemaining(r0, pairKL)
CPU times: user 36.2 s, sys: 44 ms, total: 36.3 s
Wall time: 36.4 s

In [238]: for l in nPairRem0:
     ...:     print l
     ...:     

[2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]

In [236]: %time allDeals0, pairRemDeals1, nPairRem1 = nDealsRemaining(r1, pairs)
CPU times: user 7.63 s, sys: 12 ms, total: 7.64 s
Wall time: 7.66 s

In [238]: for l in nPairRem1:
     ...:     print l
     ...:     
[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]

\section{Experimental Setup}

Note that the number of all hands that $A$ can have 
are $210$ and they can be ordered in ascending order
as shown in Table \ref{listHands}. The indices shown
in  that table are used in what follows. 

%\begin{table}

Table \ref{runsTab} shows a snapshot of the runs that were
used to check for leakage to agent $C$ as well as to compute the possible
deals that $C$ considers possible at the end of any run.
%Each possible hand of $A$ occurs in the first announcement of some run.

\input{runsTab}


Finally, the output obtained for card leakage for the $36$ runs 
as well as the actual deals that $C$ considers possible at the
end of each run (for any deal that can truthfully announce run)
are tabulated below.
